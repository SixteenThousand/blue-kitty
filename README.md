# My Kitty Configuration

This is my configuration of the kitty terminal emulator. It's pretty bare 
bones.


## Note of the default config file

If you need to generate a new version of the default configuration file, 
remove this configuration by running `make uninstall` and then run the 
`edit_config_file` action (see `man kitty.conf` for more detail on this).
